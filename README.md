# Student Management System

A command-line interface (CLI) based application developed in C++. It allows two types of users—Admin and Student—to interact with the system. Admins can efficiently manage student records by adding, removing, and viewing student information, as well as updating their class marks, attendance, and fee status. Students can view their class subjects, marks, attendance, and fee status.
